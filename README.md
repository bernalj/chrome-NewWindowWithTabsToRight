# Fork

This is a fork of Glenn 'devalias' Grant's amazing [NewWindowWithTabsToRight](https://github.com/0xdevalias/chrome-NewWindowWithTabsToRight). This extension stopped working after Chrome deprecated Manifest V3. This fork fixes the compatibility with Chrome's new policy requirements. It must be installed locally.
